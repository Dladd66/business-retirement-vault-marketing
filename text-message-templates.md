## Tailoring Guidelines

When sending mass text messages, consider these personalization guidelines:

1. **Newer leads** should receive messages emphasizing the connection to what they initially expressed interest in.
2. **Older leads** need context refreshers about who you are and what they expressed interest in.
3. **High-value leads** deserve more personalized messages, possibly mentioning specific aspects of the guide relevant to their situation.
4. **Segment by engagement** - those who have opened emails or clicked links may respond better to different messaging than completely cold contacts.

## Best Practices

1. **Timing**: Send texts between 10am-7pm local time
2. **Frequency**: Maximum of 2-3 texts per campaign
3. **Personalization**: Always include first name
4. **Call-to-Action**: Clear, direct link
5. **Response Plan**: Have replies routed to you for personal follow-up
6. **Compliance**: Include opt-out option for mass texts
